/* Order of precedence for JS files:

- makeDeck.js : creates the deck and adds it to Firebase. It's 'init' function is called on page load.
- deal.js : deals cards to players. 'deal' is called on pageload in the 'init' function. There is no practical need to wait. 
  - Correction!: fix that. Or call the functions from display hand instead of calling deal when it comes time to show the player their cards
- displayTrigger.js : all the functions required for showing cards on the screen
- displayCards.js : the actual functions that create the cards
