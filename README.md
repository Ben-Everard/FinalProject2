FinalProject2
=============

- This was my final project for Coding Dojo. 

- My partner and I decided to try to create an implementation of Texas Hold'em using:
 - Express / Node.js
 - Firebase 
 
It was a really good learning experience because it exposed me to some considerable Javascript and some new tech that 
no one in my course was familar with. 

The downside was that, as usual, we bit off more than we could chew. 

I manged to make some considerable gains in deck generation and adding it to Firebase. I ran into considerable walls when
it came to managing the asynchronous aspects of Firebase. In hindsight, due to the turn by turn aspet of Texas Holdem, 
asynchronous code is rather unnecessary. 

Also, please ignore some of the vulgar commits. Frustration and a curious attempt to get onto www.commitlogsfromlastnight.com/
led to some unnecessary commit logs :)
